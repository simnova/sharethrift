# @cellix/data-sources-mongoose

Infrastructure implementations and helpers for using MongoDB/Mongoose with Cellix domain seedwork. This package provides concrete adapters for repositories, units of work, type converters, Mongoose prop arrays, and model/connection helpers. It keeps domains persistence‑agnostic while enabling a clean, testable infrastructure layer.

- *Purpose*: provide Mongoose-based infrastructure that implements `@cellix/domain-seedwork` abstractions.
- *Scope*: repositories, unit of work, converters, model factories, adapters; no domain/business rules.
- *Prerequisites*: TypeScript 5.8, ESM, Node 22+.

For detailed persistence-side API and examples, see:
- `src/mongoose-seedwork/README.md`

## Install

```sh
npm i -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose
# or if you only need it at compile-time
npm i -D -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose
```

## Entry points

- Public API is exposed via the package root:
```ts
import { MongooseSeedwork } from '@cellix/data-sources-mongoose';
```
- Deep imports into `src/**` are not part of the public API and are not recommended.

## Usage overview

### Persistence Lifecycle
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant App as Application Layer
  participant UoW as MongoUnitOfWork
  participant Repo as MongoRepositoryBase
  participant DB as MongoDB
  participant DE as Domain Event Bus
  participant IE as Integration Event Bus

  App->>UoW: withTransaction(fn)
  UoW->>Repo: save(aggregate)
  Repo->>DE: Dispatch domain events (pre-commit)
  Repo->>DB: persist aggregate
  Repo-->>UoW: return aggregate
  UoW->>DB: commit
  DB-->>UoW: success
  UoW->>IE: Dispatch integration events (post-commit)
  UoW-->>App: return aggregate
```

- Repositories/UoW: Extend `MongoRepositoryBase`, use `MongoUnitOfWork` / `getInitializedUnitOfWork` to scope transactions and dispatch events.
- Type conversion: Implement `MongoTypeConverter` to map Mongoose docs ↔ domain aggregates via adapters.
- Prop arrays: Use `MongoosePropArray` for embedded collections on Mongoose `DocumentArray`s.
- Domain seedwork integration: Pair with `@cellix/domain-seedwork` for aggregates, entities, value objects, and events.

For full API and usage details, refer to [Mongoose Seedwork API docs](src/mongoose-seedwork/README.md).

## Dependencies

- Peer dependencies: `@cellix/domain-seedwork`, `@cellix/event-bus-seedwork-node`.
- Runtime dependencies: minimal (e.g., `@types/mongoose` typings shipped for convenience). Your app should install `mongoose`.
- Dev dependencies are used for build, lint, and test only.

## Scripts

Common scripts from `package.json` (executed in this workspace):

- Build: `npm run build -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose`
- Clean: `npm run clean -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose`
- Test: `npm run test:unit -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose`
- Lint/Format: `npm run lint -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose` / `npm run format -w @cellix/data-sources-mongoose`

## Notes

- Keep domain models free of persistence concerns; place infra code here.
- All public classes and interfaces are exported via `src/index.ts`.

## Audience and non-goals

- Audience: teams implementing infrastructure for aggregates using Mongoose.
- Non-goals: domain/business rules, GraphQL/HTTP handling.
