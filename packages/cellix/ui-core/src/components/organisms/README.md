# Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components that combine multiple molecules and/or atoms to form a distinct section of an interface. They represent more complete and self-contained parts of the UI that can be composed to create pages or application features.

## Available Organisms

Currently, no organism components have been implemented in this package yet. This directory is intended for future development of complex UI components that will combine existing molecules.

| Component Name | Source Code |
|---------------|------------|
| _No components available yet_ | - |

## Future Development

When organisms are added to this library, each will have:
- Its own directory with implementation files
- Storybook stories for development and documentation
- Comprehensive tests with Vitest
- Detailed API documentation in this README

Potential organisms that may be developed include:
- Navigation components (headers, sidebars)
- Form systems with validation
- Dashboard panels and widgets
- Modal/dialog systems
- Table components with sorting and filtering
- Card-based content containers

## API Usage

_This section will be populated when organism components are developed._
