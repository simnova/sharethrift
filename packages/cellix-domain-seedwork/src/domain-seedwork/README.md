## Domain Seedwork: API and Usage Guide

This package provides foundational, framework-agnostic building blocks for Domain-Driven Design (DDD) across the Cellix monorepo. It standardizes aggregates, entities, value objects, events, repositories, and units of work, and is intentionally free of infrastructure concerns.

## Domain Seedwork API

### Pedigree Legend

Cellix implements both Canonical DDD and Common Patterns, as well as some design choices unique to this framework. 
The **Pedigree** column in the tables below indicates the origin of each concept to avoid confusion.

- Canonical DDD — Defined by Evans/Vernon
- Common Pattern — Widely used, not formal DDD
- Cellix-specific — Cellix design/construct
- Impl detail — Implementation helper

### Aggregates & Entities

| Concept (DDD / Cellix) | Seedwork Export                              | Source File         | Pedigree        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Aggregate Root         | `AggregateRoot<Props, Passport>`             | [aggregate-root.ts](./aggregate-root.ts) | Canonical DDD   |
| Entity                 | `DomainEntity<Props>`                        | [domain-entity.ts](./domain-entity.ts)  | Canonical DDD   |
| Props Shape            | `DomainEntityProps`                          | [domain-entity.ts](./domain-entity.ts)  | Impl detail     |
| Event Registry         | `RootEventRegistry`                          | [aggregate-root.ts](./aggregate-root.ts) | Cellix-specific |
| Embedded Arrays        | `PropArray<EntityProps>`                     | [prop-array.ts](./prop-array.ts)     | Cellix-specific |

- *AggregateRoot*: Base class for aggregate roots (transaction/consistency boundary). Collects domain/integration events; optional `onSave`; supports soft delete via `isDeleted`.
- *DomainEntity*: Base class for entities with identity and behavior.
- *DomainEntityProps*: Required props shape for entities; must include `id: string`.
- *RootEventRegistry*: Type for the aggregate's internal registry for passing down root-level information to embedded entities/value objects.
- *PropArray*: Interface to manage embedded collections by prop shape (`items`, `addItem`, `getNewItem`, `removeItem`, `removeAll`).

**Example: Aggregate raising a domain event**

```ts
class Order extends DomainSeedwork.AggregateRoot<OrderProps, Passport> {
  addItem(item: Item) {
    this.addDomainEvent(new ItemAddedEvent({ itemId: item.id }));
  }
}
```

**Example: Aggregate with embedded array of entities**

```ts
class UserCustomView extends DomainSeedwork.DomainEntity<UserCustomViewProps> {}

interface UserProps extends DomainSeedwork.DomainEntityProps {
    customViews: DomainSeedwork.PropArray<UserCustomViewProps>;
}
class User extends DomainSeedwork.AggregateRoot<UserProps, Passport> {

  public requestNewCustomView(): UserCustomView {
    /* permission check */
    return new UserCustomView(this.props.customViews.getNewItem() /* + any other required constructor params */);
  }
}
```

### Value Objects

| Concept (DDD / Cellix) | Seedwork Export      | Source File       | Pedigree      |
|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Value Object           | `ValueObject<Props>` | [value-object.ts](./value-object.ts) | Canonical DDD |
| Props Shape            | `ValueObjectProps`   | [value-object.ts](./value-object.ts) | Impl detail   |

- *ValueObject*: Immutable type identified by its values; encapsulates validation/normalization; return new instances on change.
- *ValueObjectProps*: Marker interface for value-object property shapes.

**Example: Email Value Object with validation**

```ts
interface EmailProps extends DomainSeedwork.ValueObjectProps {
  value: string;
}
class Email extends DomainSeedwork.ValueObject<EmailProps> {
  constructor(props: EmailProps) {
    super(props);
    if (!props.value.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}
```

### Events & Messaging

| Concept (DDD / Cellix) | Seedwork Export                                    | Source File       | Pedigree       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Domain Event           | `DomainEvent`                                      | [domain-event.ts](./domain-event.ts) | Canonical DDD  |
| Typed Event            | `CustomDomainEvent<T>`, `CustomDomainEventImpl<T>` | [domain-event.ts](./domain-event.ts) | Common Pattern |
| Event Bus              | `EventBus`                                         | [event-bus.ts](./event-bus.ts)    | Common Pattern |

- *DomainEvent*: Base interface for events produced by aggregates; carries `aggregateId`.
- *CustomDomainEvent* / *CustomDomainEventImpl*: Typed event with `payload`; convenience base for strongly-typed event definitions.
- *EventBus*: Contract to `dispatch(EventClass, payload)` and `register(EventClass, handler)` for event publication and subscription.

**Example: Registering and handling an event**

```ts
// Domain event
interface UserRegisteredProps { userId: string; }
class UserRegisteredEvent extends DomainSeedwork.CustomDomainEventImpl<UserRegisteredProps> {}

// Event bus usage (import instance that implements `EventBus`)
eventBus.register(UserRegisteredEvent, async (payload) => {
  await sendWelcomeEmail(payload.userId);
});

// MongoRepository and MongoUnitOfWork handle dispatching events automatically (see `@cellix/data-sources-mongoose`)
```

### Repositories & Units of Work

| Concept (DDD / Cellix) | Seedwork Export                                             | Source File        | Pedigree        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Repository             | `Repository<T>`                                             | [repository.ts](./repository.ts)    | Canonical DDD   |
| Unit of Work           | `UnitOfWork`, `InitializedUnitOfWork`                       | [unit-of-work.ts](./unit-of-work.ts)  | Common Pattern  |
| Mapper/Adapter         | `TypeConverter<Persistence, DomainProps, Passport, Domain>` | [type-converter.ts](./type-converter.ts) | Common Pattern  |

- *Repository*: Encapsulates data access for interacting with a single aggregate root in the domain, providing read/write methods like `get` and `save`.
- *UnitOfWork* / *InitializedUnitOfWork*: Manages transactional boundaries and coordinates repository operations for a single aggregate root.
- *TypeConverter*: Handles mapping between persistence models and domain objects, keeping aggregates persistence-agnostic.

**Example: Using a repository with Unit of Work**

```ts
// Application Layer
await uow.withTransaction(passport, async (repo) => {
    const order = await repo.get(orderId);
    order.addItem(item);                    // domain logic (AggregateRoot)
    await repo.save(order);                 // triggers persistence + event collection
});                                         // publishes collected events post-commit
```

**Example: Type conversion between persistence and domain**

```ts
const order = converter.toDomain(doc, passport);
const doc = converter.toPersistence(order);
```

### Context & Errors

| Concept (DDD / Cellix)  | Seedwork Export              | Source File                        | Pedigree        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Execution Context Marker| `BaseDomainExecutionContext` | [base-domain-execution-context.ts](./base-domain-execution-context.ts) | Cellix-specific |
| Authorization Error     | `PermissionError`            | [domain-entity.ts](./domain-entity.ts)                 | Common Pattern  |
| Not Found Error         | `NotFoundError`              | [repository.ts](./repository.ts)                    | Common Pattern  |

- *BaseDomainExecutionContext*: Marker you extend for your app’s execution context (e.g., used in Passports).
- *PermissionError*: Throw for authorization failures within domain logic; translate at application boundaries.
- *NotFoundError*: Indicates repository `get` misses; translate to domain-appropriate errors at boundaries.

**Example: Passport validation in aggregate command**

```ts
if (!passport.canEdit(order)) {
  throw new PermissionError('Not allowed');
}
```

## Developer Guidance

### Design Intent

- Keep business rules inside aggregates and value objects; keep application services thin.
- Use events to record meaningful domain facts. Keep payloads small and stable.
- Keep mapping concerns (DB ↔ domain) out of aggregates via `TypeConverter`.
- This package defines contracts and base classes only; infrastructure lives in other `@cellix` packages.

---

### Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects

- Aggregates are the root entities that define consistency boundaries. Use aggregates to enforce invariants and encapsulate business logic.
- Aggregates can be composed of entities and value objects.
- Entities are mutable and have a distinct identity. They encapsulate behavior and can change over time.
- Value objects are immutable and defined by their attributes. They should be treated as first-class citizens and can be used to capture constraints for related properties.

### Event Guidance

- Domain events describe facts within the same bounded context. Integration events are for cross-context/service communication.
- Aggregates collect events via `addDomainEvent` and `addIntegrationEvent` during command handling.
- After successful persistence, the application/infrastructure layer publishes collected events through an `EventBus` implementation.

### Repository and Unit of Work Guidance

- Repositories focus on a single aggregate root type and implement `get`/`save`. Add domain-specific methods as needed (e.g., factory-like `getNewInstance`, specialized loaders).
- Units of Work coordinate transactional boundaries and provide the correctly scoped repository instance to callers.
- In this repo, many UoW interfaces combine both `UnitOfWork` and `InitializedUnitOfWork` for flexible transaction scoping.

### Authorization and Context

- Use domain-specific Passports/Visas to evaluate permissions within aggregate roots.
- Throw `PermissionError` when a rule is violated; translate this error at the application boundary.
