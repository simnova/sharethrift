 * Registration of integration event handlers.

 * should be implemented as application services that listen to domain events
 * published by the aggregate roots.
 * 
 * For the ReservationAcceptedEvent:
 * - The domain event is emitted when a reservation is accepted
 * - An application service or background worker should:
 *   1. Listen for this event
 *   2. Create a conversation thread between reserver and sharer
 *   3. Send notification emails to both parties
 * 
 * This separation keeps domain logic pure and allows flexible event handling.
