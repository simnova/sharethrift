# Copilot Instructions: Container Components

## Purpose

- Container components manage data fetching, business logic, and state for their corresponding presentational components.
- They separate concerns by isolating side effects, API calls, and state management from UI rendering.

## Architecture & Patterns

- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Each container component (`*.container.tsx`) wraps a presentational component, passing props derived from state, context, or API responses.
- **Co-location**: Place container components next to their presentational counterparts and related `.graphql` files for maintainability.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Use Apollo Client hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, etc.) for data operations. Import queries/mutations from adjacent `.graphql` files.

## Coding Conventions

- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Suffix container components with `Container` (e.g., `ProfileViewContainer`).
- Component name must match file name in PascalCase.
- Each container must define a `{ComponentName}ContainerProps` type for its props.
- Use strict TypeScript types for all state, props, and API responses.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Provide handler functions through display component props for all relevant actions (e.g., handleClick, handleChange, handleSubmit, handleSave).

## State Management

- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) for local and shared state only when necessary. Avoid prop drilling and trivial state management solutions.

## Data Fetching

- Use Apollo Client hooks for GraphQL queries and mutations.
- Leverage the shared `ComponentQueryLoader` component for consistent data fetching, loading, and error handling.

## Error Handling

- Use the `ComponentQueryLoader` for consistent error handling and fallback UI via the optional `errorComponent` or `noDataComponent` props

## Accessibility

- Ensure all rendered UI is accessible, including loading and error states.


## File Organization

- Place container components in the same folder as their presentational components and related `.graphql` files.
- Align container and presentational components by keeping their file names consistent (e.g., `profile-view.container.tsx` and `profile-view.tsx`).
