Sharethrift documentation features are designed to help developers understand and implement Domain-Driven Design patterns with Azure Functions and modern web technologies.

Here are a few tips to get you started with Sharethrift development.

<!-- truncate -->

Simply explore the `packages` directory to understand the modular architecture.

Regular contributors can be added to the team through our development workflow.

The project follows semantic versioning and clear release cycles:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document key decisions
- Domain contexts are organized under `packages/sthrift/domain/src/domain/contexts/`

Sharethrift provides comprehensive examples for DDD implementation:

The documentation supports categorized content as well!

**Getting Started**: Clone the repository, run `npm run clean && npm install && npm run build`, then use `npm run dev` to start the full development environment.
