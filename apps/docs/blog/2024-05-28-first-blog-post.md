Welcome to Sharethrift, a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) monorepo built on Azure Functions with GraphQL/REST APIs and MongoDB persistence. This framework provides a modern approach to building scalable applications with clear separation of concerns.

Sharethrift implements a multi-layered architecture following strict DDD principles with bounded contexts for community management and user administration. The project includes specialized packages like `@sthrift/api-domain` for business logic, `@sthrift/api-graphql` for GraphQL implementation, and various service packages for MongoDB connectivity and observability.
