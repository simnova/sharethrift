# CodeQL (GitHub Advanced Security)

## Threat Assessment Overview
GitHub CodeQL provides advanced static application security testing (SAST) capabilities to identify security vulnerabilities in source code through semantic code analysis.

## Assessment Classification
- **Assessment Type**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Approach Used**: TBD
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-30
- **Date First Implemented**: TBD
- **Date Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-30
- **Date Retired**: N/A

## Implementation Approach
TBD

## Coverage Scope
**Target Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js
**Security Detection**: SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection, authentication bypasses
**Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow with automated PR and push analysis

## Implementation Status
**Current State**: Not implemented
**GitHub Actions**: No CodeQL workflow configuration found
**Repository**: GitHub Advanced Security features not enabled
**Alternative**: SonarCloud provides overlapping SAST coverage

## Success Criteria
TBD

## Compensating Controls
- SonarCloud static analysis provides comprehensive SAST coverage
- Manual security code review through pull request process
- TypeScript strict mode compilation catches type-related vulnerabilities

## Technical Requirements
- GitHub Advanced Security license
- CodeQL workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/`
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Security policy definition for vulnerability handling
