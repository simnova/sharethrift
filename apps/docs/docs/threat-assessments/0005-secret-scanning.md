# GitHub Secret Scanning

## Threat Assessment Overview
GitHub Secret Scanning provides automated detection of credentials, API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data accidentally committed to the repository to prevent security breaches.

## Assessment Classification
- **Assessment Type**: Secret Detection / Credential Security
- **Approach Used**: TBD
- **Status**: Not Implemented
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-30
- **Date First Implemented**: TBD
- **Date Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-30
- **Date Retired**: N/A

## Implementation Approach
TBD

## Coverage Scope
**Secret Types**: API keys, authentication tokens, database credentials, private keys, certificates
**Detection**: Commit history scanning, real-time push protection, pull request analysis
**Integrations**: Azure service connection strings, OAuth tokens, payment processor credentials
**Notification**: Automated alerts for detected secrets with remediation guidance

## Implementation Status
**Current State**: Not implemented
**GitHub Advanced Security**: Secret scanning features not enabled
**Push Protection**: No real-time secret detection on commits
**Alternative**: Manual credential management through Azure Key Vault

## Success Criteria
- Real-time detection of secrets before they reach the repository
- Historical scan of existing codebase for exposed credentials
- Automated alerts with clear remediation steps
- Zero high-confidence secret exposures in production code

## Compensating Controls
**Azure Key Vault Integration**:
- Sensitive configuration stored in Azure Key Vault
- Function app managed identity for secret access
- Environment-specific configuration separation

**Development Practices**:
- Environment variable usage for all sensitive data
- Local configuration files in .gitignore
- Code review process for configuration changes

**Infrastructure Security**:
- Azure service connections for deployment automation
- Managed identities for inter-service authentication
- RBAC-based access control for Azure resources

## Technical Requirements
- GitHub Advanced Security license
- Repository secret scanning enablement
- Push protection configuration
- Integration with existing security incident response

## Detection Patterns
**High-Priority Secrets**:
- Azure storage account keys and connection strings
- MongoDB connection strings with credentials
- OAuth client secrets and API keys
- Payment processor API credentials
- Private signing keys and certificates

**Repository-Specific Patterns**:
- SonarCloud tokens (SONAR_TOKEN)
- Azure service principal credentials
- Third-party service API keys (SendGrid, Twilio, etc.)
