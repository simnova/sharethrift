Blocked listings must be appealed and reviewed before being reinstated.

## Control Classification

- **Nature Control Category**: Administrative
- **Status**: Identified
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-29
- **Date First Implemented**: TBD
- **Date Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-29
- **Date Retired**: N/A

## Replacement Control

## Implementation Approach

The ShareThrift platform implements a comprehensive listing appeal and review workflow that ensures blocked listings undergo proper administrative review before reinstatement, maintaining platform content quality and community safety standards.

**Listing State Management System**
- ItemListing domain entity supports seven distinct states: 'Published', 'Paused', 'Cancelled', 'Drafted', 'Expired', 'Blocked', 'Appeal Requested'
- ListingState value object with static instances provides type-safe state transitions
- MongoDB schema enforcement with LISTING_STATE_ENUM validates allowable states
- State transitions tracked through updatedAt timestamps for audit compliance

**User-Initiated Appeal Process**
- Blocked listings display "Appeal" button in My Listings dashboard with confirmation modal
- Appeal action transitions listing from 'Blocked' to 'Appeal Requested' state using domain entity methods
- UI components prevent multiple appeals through status-based button rendering
- Appeal confirmation requires explicit user acceptance: "Are you sure you want to appeal the block on this listing?"

**Admin Review Dashboard Architecture**
- Centralized admin dashboard lists blocked and appeal-requested listings with filtering capabilities
- Admin interface supports three primary actions: View Listing, Unblock Listing, Remove Listing
- Appeal-requested listings distinguished from blocked listings in admin table view
- Review workflow requires explicit admin decision to approve or deny appeals

**GraphQL-Based State Management**
- ItemListing resolvers handle state transitions through domain application services
- State mapping functions convert internal domain states to UI-friendly statuses
- Appeal_Requested state properly mapped for GraphQL schema compatibility
- Real-time state updates through Apollo Client refetch policies

**Domain-Driven Review Validation**
- ItemListing aggregate root enforces business rules for state transitions
- Passport/Visa authorization system validates admin permissions for unblocking operations
- Domain validation prevents invalid state transitions and unauthorized modifications
- Publishing permissions checked through canPublishItemListing domain permission

**Administrative Control Framework**
- Admin dashboard displays blocked listings with status indicators and action buttons
- Review process supports manual unblocking after administrative evaluation
- Admin actions generate audit events for compliance and user communication
- Block reasons and descriptions maintained for appeal review context

## Compensating Controls

**Multi-Stage Review Process**
- Appeals cannot be automatically approved; manual admin review required for all reinstatements
- Admin dashboard separates blocked listings from appeal-requested listings for clear workflow management
- Review decisions logged through domain events and state change tracking
- Administrative actions require explicit confirmation to prevent accidental approvals

**State-Based Access Control**
- Blocked listings prevented from receiving reservation requests or appearing in public searches
- Appeal-requested state maintains blocking while signaling need for admin review
- State transitions validated through domain rules preventing unauthorized listing activation
- UI components respect listing states to prevent user confusion about availability

**Audit Trail Maintenance**
- All listing state changes recorded with timestamps through updatedAt field tracking
- Administrative review decisions logged through GraphQL resolver actions
- Appeal submissions tracked through state transitions from Blocked to Appeal Requested
- Review outcomes documented through subsequent state changes to Published or continued Blocked status

**Content Quality Enforcement**
- Appeals require users to acknowledge and potentially edit problematic content before submission
- Admin review process evaluates listing content against platform policies before approval
- Blocked listings remain inaccessible to prevent policy violations during appeal period
- Repeat violations tracked through listing history for escalating enforcement actions

**User Communication Framework**
- Clear appeal process communicated through UI button placement and confirmation modals
- Listing owners informed of appeal status through My Listings dashboard state indicators
- Administrative decisions conveyed through listing status changes and optional messaging
- Appeal confirmation messages explain consequences and requirements for submission

## Context and Problem Statement

**Content Moderation Requirements**
The ShareThrift platform requires systematic review of blocked listings to ensure legitimate content can be restored while preventing re-publication of policy-violating material. Without proper appeal and review processes, users have no recourse when listings are incorrectly blocked, while administrators lack structured workflows to evaluate disputed content.

**Administrative Workload Management**
Platform administrators need efficient systems to review appeals and make informed decisions about listing reinstatement. The appeal process must balance user rights to contest moderation decisions with administrative efficiency and platform safety requirements.

**Platform Trust and Transparency**
A fair and transparent appeal process builds user trust by providing clear paths for contesting moderation decisions. Users must understand how to appeal blocks and what review processes their listings will undergo, while administrators need visibility into appeal queues and decision history.

**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
Appeal and review processes support regulatory requirements for content moderation transparency, due process in platform enforcement, and user rights to contest automated or human moderation decisions affecting their economic participation.

## Technical Requirements

**REQ-4.1: Appeal Submission Process**
- Blocked listings MUST display "Appeal" button in user's My Listings dashboard
- Appeal action MUST transition listing state from 'Blocked' to 'Appeal Requested'

- Only listings in 'Blocked' state MUST be eligible for appeal submission

**REQ-4.2: Admin Review Dashboard**
- Admin dashboard MUST display separate sections for 'Blocked' and 'Appeal Requested' listings
- Each listing MUST show: title, image, published date, reservation period, current status
- Admin actions MUST include: View Listing, Unblock Listing, Remove Listing
- Review interface MUST support filtering by appeal status and submission date

**REQ-4.3: State Transition Management**
- ItemListing domain entity MUST enforce valid state transitions through business rules
- State changes MUST be persisted immediately with updatedAt timestamp updates
- Invalid state transitions MUST be prevented through domain validation
