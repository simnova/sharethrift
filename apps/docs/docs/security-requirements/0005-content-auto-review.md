## Implementation Approach

The ShareThrift platform requires implementation of comprehensive automated content review capabilities to ensure all user-generated listings and profile content meet platform safety and policy standards before publication, while supporting manual review workflows for complex cases.

**Draft-to-Published Workflow Foundation**
- ItemListing domain entity supports 'Drafted' state for content pending automated review
- Publishing workflow transitions listings from 'Drafted' to 'Published' only after automated validation
- Domain validation through ItemListing.publish() method enforces permission checks and state transitions
- CreateListing interface allows saving as draft or publishing with automatic review gates

**Content Validation Architecture (To Be Implemented)**
- Text content analysis for profanity, spam, and policy violations using Azure Content Moderator or similar service
- Image content scanning integrated with existing Azure Blob Storage malware detection infrastructure
- Automated content scoring with configurable thresholds for auto-approve, manual review, or auto-block decisions
- Content validation service integration with domain events for audit trails and monitoring

**Listing Content Review Pipeline**
- Title, description, and category fields require automated text analysis before publication
- Image uploads leverage existing Azure Blob Storage security with Microsoft Defender scanning
- Location and availability information validated against platform policies and geographical restrictions
- Profile content including user descriptions, location data, and personal information subject to same validation pipeline

**Integration with Existing Infrastructure**
- Azure Blob Storage file upload system already includes malware scanning via Microsoft Defender for Storage
- Existing domain permission system through Passport/Visa architecture supports content validation workflows
- GraphQL mutation pipeline provides integration points for automated review services
- Event-driven architecture enables real-time content review notifications and status updates

**Manual Review Escalation System**
- Content flagged by automated systems moves to admin review queue for human evaluation
- Admin dashboard integration displays pending content reviews alongside user and listing moderation
- Appeal process for content blocked by automated systems follows existing listing appeal workflow
- Administrative override capabilities for content review decisions with audit logging

**Policy Enforcement Framework**
- Configurable content policies for different content types (listings, profiles, messages)
- Machine learning model integration for evolving threat detection and content classification
- Automated response actions: auto-approve, require manual review, auto-block with user notification
- Content policy violation tracking for user reputation and escalating enforcement actions

## Compensating Controls

**Multi-Layer Content Validation**
- Automated content analysis combined with user reporting mechanisms for community-driven moderation
- Manual admin review queue for content flagged by automated systems or user reports
- Appeal process allows users to contest automated content blocking decisions
- Content policy documentation provides clear guidelines for acceptable platform content

**Infrastructure Security Integration**
- Azure Blob Storage malware scanning prevents malicious file uploads regardless of content review status
- Content validation occurs before publication, preventing policy-violating content from becoming publicly visible
- Existing authentication and authorization systems ensure only verified users can submit content for review
- Domain-layer validation prevents bypass of content review requirements through direct API access

**Audit and Monitoring Systems**
- All automated content review decisions logged with confidence scores and reasoning
- Content review metrics tracked for system performance monitoring and policy effectiveness
- False positive/negative tracking enables continuous improvement of automated review accuracy
- Administrative review actions audited for compliance and quality assurance

**User Communication and Education**
- Clear content policy guidelines provided during account creation and listing submission
- Automated content rejection includes specific policy violation explanations
- Appeal process provides users recourse for incorrectly blocked content
- Content policy updates communicated to users with grace periods for compliance

**Escalation and Override Mechanisms**
- Administrative override capabilities for complex content review cases
- Escalation procedures for repeated policy violations or edge cases requiring human judgment
- Content review queue prioritization based on user reputation, content type, and violation severity
- Emergency procedures for coordinated abuse or platform security threats

## Context and Problem Statement

**Platform Safety Requirements**
The ShareThrift platform requires comprehensive automated content review to prevent publication of harmful, illegal, inappropriate, or policy-violating content. Without automated screening, malicious users can publish dangerous content, scams, spam, harassment, or illegal material that harms community safety and platform reputation.

**Scale and Efficiency Needs**
Manual content review cannot scale with platform growth and user-generated content volume. Automated systems enable rapid content evaluation while preserving human judgment for complex cases, ensuring timely content publication for legitimate users while maintaining safety standards.

**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
Automated content review supports compliance with platform liability regulations, content moderation requirements, and digital services act provisions. The system must demonstrate proactive content screening capabilities and maintain audit trails for regulatory reporting.

**User Experience Balance**
Content review must balance safety requirements with user experience, ensuring legitimate content publishes quickly while preventing harmful material from reaching the platform. Transparent policies and appeal processes maintain user trust while enabling effective content moderation.

## Technical Requirements
