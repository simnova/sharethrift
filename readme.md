# ShareThrift

A modern, community‑driven platform designed to reduce waste and enable the sharing of items, services, and classes — empowering individuals and organizations to participate in the circular economy.

## 📌 Introduction

ShareThrift is a web‑based peer‑to‑peer sharing platform that enables people and organizations to lend, borrow, or offer items, services, and classes. Inspired by platforms like Turo, Airbnb, and Facebook Marketplace — but built specifically for the sharing economy — ShareThrift provides a structured, trusted, and community-first way to exchange goods.

### ShareThrift exists to:

- Reduce consumer waste by extending item lifecycles
- Enable cost‑efficient access to tools, equipment, and skills
- Support individuals, small businesses, and partners with flexible sharing models
- Explore modern technology and product design patterns through an MVP implementation
- This project is built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), event-driven communication, and modular application boundaries as specified in the official BRD/SRD.
