# Code Review Comments Addressed

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to address the code review comments for the reservation refactoring PR.

## 1. Extract and Share Enum-to-Tag Mapping Function ✅

**Issue**: `mapReservationState` function was duplicated in multiple components.

**Solution**: 
- Created shared utility: `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/utils/reservation-state-mapper.ts`
- Updated `reservations-table.tsx` and `reservation-card.tsx` to import and use the shared function
- Removed duplicate function definitions from both components

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/utils/reservation-state-mapper.ts` (new)
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/my-reservations/components/reservations-table.tsx`
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/my-reservations/components/reservation-card.tsx`

## 2. Consolidate Storybook MockedProvider Wrappers ✅

**Issue**: Repeated MockedProvider decorators and boilerplate across stories.

**Solution**:
- Created shared Storybook provider utilities: `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/test/utils/storybook-providers.tsx`
- Added `withApolloMocks` decorator function and `createMockedProviderWrapper` helper
- Updated `my-reservations.stories.tsx` to use the new helper, reducing boilerplate by ~70%

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/test/utils/storybook-providers.tsx` (new)
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/my-reservations/stories/my-reservations.stories.tsx`

## 3. Refactor Mock Data Using Factory Functions ✅

**Issue**: 400+ lines of near-duplicate mock data in `mock-reservation-requests.ts`.

**Solution**:
- Created factory functions: `packages/sthrift/persistence/src/datasources/readonly/reservation-request/reservation-request/helpers/mock-factories.ts`
- Added `createUser`, `createListing`, and `createRole` factory functions
- Refactored main mock file to use factories, reducing from 400+ lines to ~50 lines
- Maintained all existing functionality while eliminating duplication

**Files Changed**:
- `packages/sthrift/persistence/src/datasources/readonly/reservation-request/reservation-request/helpers/mock-factories.ts` (new)
- `packages/sthrift/persistence/src/datasources/readonly/reservation-request/reservation-request/mock-reservation-requests.ts`

## 4. Create Reusable Mock AuthContext Factory ✅

**Issue**: Verbose inline `AuthContextProps` implementation in `MessagesPage.stories.tsx`.

**Solution**:
- Created reusable auth mock utilities: `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/test/utils/mockAuth.ts`
- Added `createMockAuth` and `createMockUser` factory functions
- Simplified `MessagesPage.stories.tsx` MockAuthWrapper from ~70 lines to ~10 lines
- Made auth mocking reusable across all Storybook stories

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/test/utils/mockAuth.ts` (new)
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/messages/stories/MessagesPage.stories.tsx`

## 5. Optimize Fetch Policies and Cache Updates ✅

**Issue**: Blanket use of `fetchPolicy: 'network-only'` and `refetchQueries` causing unnecessary refetches.

**Solution**:
- Changed fetch policy from `network-only` to `cache-first` with proper filtering
- Replaced `refetchQueries` with efficient cache updates using `cache.evict()` and `cache.gc()`
- Updated mutation handlers to use optimistic cache updates instead of refetching
- Maintained cache consistency while improving performance

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/my-reservations/components/reservations-view-active.container.tsx`
- `apps/ui-sharethrift/src/components/layouts/home/my-reservations/components/reservations-view-history.container.tsx`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Shared utilities reduce duplication and centralize logic
2. **Performance**: Optimized cache strategies reduce unnecessary network requests
3. **Developer Experience**: Simplified Storybook setup with reusable providers
4. **Code Quality**: Eliminated 400+ lines of duplicate mock data
5. **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing while reducing boilerplate

## Testing

- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Linting errors addressed
- Storybook stories continue to work with new shared utilities
- Cache optimization maintains existing functionality while improving performance

## Next Steps

These changes address all the major code review comments while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall codebase quality. The shared utilities can be reused across other parts of the application as needed.
