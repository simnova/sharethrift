# Data Management

## Data Retention Strategy

This section outlines the data retention strategy for both operational and image storage systems, including deletion policies. The strategy ensures efficient storage management, compliance, and scalability while supporting long-term data access and integrity.

1. **Operational Database: Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)**

**Short-term Retention**

* Listings and Reservation Requests: All listings and reservation requests regardless of state will be stored in Azure Cosmos DB using the MongoDB API, offering high availability and low-latency access for operational purposes.
* **Auto-Archival Policy**: Once a listing or request is cancelled or expired, it will be considered “archived” for 6 months. A reservation request that is completed is “archived” for 6 months as well.

**Deletion Policy**

* **Expired and Cancelled Listings**: Any listings that remain in a cancelled or expired state will be automatically deleted after 6 months. This ensures that inactive listings are removed from the operational database without consuming unnecessary resources.
* Completed Reservation Requests: Any reservation requests in the completed state will be deleted after 6 months have passed.

1. **Document Storage: Azure Blob Storage**

Azure Blob Storage serves as the storage solution for images, such as PNGs, and JPEGs. Images stored in Blob Storage will be remain for the lifetime of the listing, or as long as it is kept for the the user profile.

**Document Overwriting Policies**

* **Images:** When a user uploads a new profile picture, the previous will be overrited and removed from blog storage. When uploading a listing photo to the same slot as one that already exists, it will also be overwrited and removed from blog storage.

**Image Retention**

* Only profile pictures will be kept indefinitely; other images tied to listings will be removed at the end of that lifecycle.

**Access to Images**

* Images stored in Azure Blob Storage will be accessible via API or manual queries for any operational or compliance needs.

### Summary of Events

Cross-system events are either emitted from the ShareThrift System to be consumed by other systems or produced by other systems to be consumed by the ShareThrift System.

The ShareThrift System will leverage Azure Storage Queues to handle events that cross system boundaries; the following table summarizes the events that enable cross-system communications.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
