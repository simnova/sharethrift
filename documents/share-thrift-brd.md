## Project Overview

ShareThrift aims to help reduce waste by encouraging the growth of the sharing economy allowing sharing of all sorts of goods such as tools, board games, and more among its members and partner organizations. ShareThrift's business model is to be self-sustaining by charging a fee for boosted listings on its platform. There are a number of different sharing models to be supported, allowing for individual to individual, as well as allowing for partners. Partners can be existing companies such as tool rental companies, or the platform may help to spur new businesses. ShareThrift is looking to develop a minimal viable product (MVP) to prove its business model.

### Problem

As peer-to-peer services like Turo, Airbnb, and Swimply gain popularity, there is a growing demand for a generalized, secure, and trusted platform that supports the sharing and reserving of a wide variety of goods and services. Current platforms are often limited in scope only handling reserving and sharing within niche categories.

### Goal

Design and develop **ShareThrift**, a web-based platform that enables individuals and organizations to share and reserve items, services, and classes with ease. Similar to Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, but focused specifically on sharing, ShareThrift aims to provide a more structured and secure experience for temporary exchanges. This project serves as a proof of concept to explore modern web technologies and product design strategies, rather than launching a commercial product.

### Business Goals

#### User Acquisition and Growth

Target an initial user base of at least 100 active users within the first month following launch. Aim for a sustained month-over-month growth rate of 20%, driven by targeted outreach, user referrals, and platform usability.

#### Market Positioning

Establish ShareThrift as a modern, community-driven alternative to traditional classifieds and niche sharing platforms. Differentiate through a focused sharing model, streamlined user experience, and trust-building features such as verified accounts and user ratings.

#### Revenue Model

Offer core platform features free of charge by generating revenue through optional paid enhancements such as boosted listings and premium account tiers (e.g., Personal Plus, Business, Business Plus), which are processed securely through third-party payment platforms. All item rental or reserving transactions are arranged independently between users, keeping the platform financially lightweight.

* Escrow/payment coordination for item rentals
* Process for handling returns/disputes
* Reserver legal signing of sharing terms per item

## Business Model

The platform operates on a freemium model. Core sharing functionality is available to all users at no cost. Revenue is generated through optional upgrades, including Boosted Listings and Premium Accounts, which enhance listing visibility and account capabilities.

### Revenue Strategy

#### Boosted Listings

Users can pay to increase listing visibility for longer durations.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Duration** | **Cost Per Listing** |
| 1 month | $0.99 |
| 3 – 6 months | $4.99 |
| > 7 months | $9.99 |

#### Premium Accounts

Users can pay for an optional monthly subscription to access enhanced account features, such as more saved listings or increased reservation capacity.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plan Name** | **Monthly Fee** | **Features** |
| Verified Personal Plus | $4.99/month | **Account Details:**   * Monthly fee * Max 30 reserved items * 30 listing bookmarks * 50 items to share   + Expandable to 150 for additional cost * Restricted to 30 friends   + Expandable to 100 for additional cost |

## Logistics

### Risks

#### Manual Admin Reviews

Verifying business accounts and reviewing flagged listings by hand introduces lag and requires human resources that may not scale with user growth. This could delay publication or strain resources. This can also lead to frustrated users due to wait times, delayed listing visibility, and bottlenecked onboarding for Business and Plus users. To mitigate this risk, we should develop clear internal review workflows and rules for verifying and implement bots and checkers to auto review listings.

#### Third-Party Costs

Identity verification and SMS/email notifications depend on external providers. Free quotas may be quickly depleted, especially during early growth. This can lead to unexpected billing overages or feature suspension (e.g., verification failures or blocked messages). To mitigate this risk, we should prioritize use cases and investigate open-source or lower-cost alternatives.

#### Timeline

The target release date may not allow for full implementation of tiered user systems, listing management, messaging, moderation tools, and trust features. This could lead to delayed delivery, scope reduction, and stakeholder dissatisfaction. To mitigate this risk, we should use a tiered delivery (Bronze/Silver/Gold), and consider feature prioritization.

### Constraints

#### Budget

The project must operate within a $150/month MSDN Azure credit, which includes: Hosting and computing, database services, and third-party marketplace tools. All environments (development, staging, production) must share this budget.

#### Time to Market

The platform must reach a functional MVP release by December 25, 2025 (6 months) with Gold, Silver, and Bronze timelines as defined in the SRD. Bronze tier incorporates bare minimum features, silver incorporates all core functionality, and gold incorporates enhanced features. Any features not in scope for the Gold release must be clearly documented as future-phase items.

#### Listing Limits

Per user limits like drafts, active listings, friends and bookmarks are determined by membership tier. Higher listing limits are only granted through manual admin review or account upgrade.

#### Security and Privacy

No in-app financial transactions, users are responsible for payment arrangements off-platform. No sensitive data storage, including payment credentials, social security numbers, or government IDs, all identity verification must be handled via secure third-party platforms.

#### Moderation and Support

Requested reviews are evaluated by bots and checkers first. All higher level content moderation is manual during MVP phase. No 24/7 customer support, response time for reports, reviews, or inquiries is 2–3 business days. Users must agree to community guidelines upon account creation; violation handling is manual.

### Assumptions

* Rely on a third-party service with limited monthly verifications at no cost
* A third-party payment processor like Stripe or PayPal will handle premium accounts and subscription fees
* Manual listing review and moderation is feasible with initial staff resources
* Predefined category types with optional fields meet Phase 1 needs

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Admin Moderation Response Times

1. Admin should review reported users and blocked listings within 2–3 business days
2. Appeals from blocked users should be resolved within 3–5 business days
3. Appeals for blocked listings should be resolved within 2–3 business days

#### Support Availability

1. Users should receive responses to general support requests within 2 business days
