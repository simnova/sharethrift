# Contributing to ShareThrift

Thank you for your interest in improving ShareThrift. This guide explains how to propose changes, create issues (including using GitHub Copilot’s coding agent), follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) conventions, and get your pull requests reviewed and merged.

## Principles & Project Scope
ShareThrift promotes sustainable reuse via a peer‑to‑peer sharing platform. We prioritize:
- Clear business‑aligned domain models (aggregates, entities, value objects)
- Maintainable modular boundaries (bounded contexts)
- Event-driven evolution (domain & future integration events)
- Simplicity first; avoid premature generalization

## Ways to Contribute
- Report bugs & usability issues
- Propose enhancements (features, performance, observability, tooling)
- Improve domain model clarity & documentation
- Add tests (unit, integration, scenario/feature)
- Write or refine ADRs for architectural decisions
- Improve developer experience (scripts, tasks)
